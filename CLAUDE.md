# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project identity

**Carbon Shade / 碳影** — a Phaser 3 + TypeScript 2.5D combat prototype served by Vite. The current engineering name is **Combat Lab**. The canonical repository path is `carbon-shade-web`. This prototype validates DNF-style 2.5D combat feel: skill execution, monster feedback, boss behavior, normalized sprite assets, and deterministic behavior tests.

## Commands

- `npm install` — install dependencies (Node >= 20).
- `npm run dev` — start Vite dev server on `0.0.0.0:5173`.
- `npm run typecheck` — run `tsc --noEmit` on `src/` via `scripts/typecheck.mjs`.
- `npm run build` — compile TypeScript and emit `dist/index.html` + browser ESM via `scripts/build.mjs`.
- `npm run static:test` — compile and run `tests/static/*.test.ts` via `scripts/static-test.mjs`, outputting `.tmp/static-test-results.json`.
- `docker compose up --build` — run the app container on port 5173.

Browser screenshot verification scripts are intentionally excluded from npm commands — they can hang on Windows. Use the three stable checks above (`typecheck`, `static:test`, `build`) for code validation.

## Documentation module

All design, planning, and research decisions are stored in `docs/`. This is the project's long-term knowledge base — consult it before making architectural changes. Documents are organized into five functional directories. See `docs/README.md` for a navigable index categorized by status (current, historical, aspirational, research).

## Architecture


The combat kernel (`src/combat/`) is pure TypeScript with **no Phaser imports** — it can run deterministically in Node for tests. Rendering lives in `src/game/` and translates kernel state into Phaser display objects. Data modules (`src/data/`) are pure data — no logic.

## Coding conventions

- ES modules with `.js` extension in import specifiers (for NodeNext module resolution).
- PascalCase for classes and scenes (`CombatKernel`, `BootScene`); lowercase domain-qualified names for data files (`berserker.normal.ts`).
- Compact TypeScript style — follow existing code when editing nearby.
- Two-space indentation in JSON.
- Runtime asset paths in `public/assets/` are stable — tests and loaders reference them by string path.

## Performance boundaries

This is a demo-grade project. Prioritize fixes for:
- Runtime FPS drops during active combat.
- Heap or replay/event memory growth over time.
- Input latency degradation over long sessions.
- Per-frame cloning, allocation, texture creation, or unbounded archive growth.

Acceptable as backlog:
- First-load texture decode/upload spikes (image decode, texImage2D, shader init).
- Initial scene-construction spikes from Phaser Text/Graphics creation.
- Large normalized spritesheet decode cost (unless it blocks basic usability).

Known constraints:
- Commit `c4d3b22` fixed replay history blowup — replay frames must only store that frame's newly flushed events, never clone the full archive.
- For future optimization, consider dirty-checking values that are set every frame: `setTexture`, `setText`, `setSize`, `setColor` in `CombatScene.ts` are currently called unconditionally — adding guards when values haven't changed would reduce repeated GPU calls; similarly, debug HUD text and FPS display could be throttled or guarded behind visibility checks.

## Git workflow

- Concise imperative commit subjects: `Fix normalized sprite frame clamp`.
- PRs should include: change scope, commands run, verification artifacts touched, and screenshots or replay JSON when visual behavior changes.
- Before claiming completion: run the relevant verification command and summarize the result. Do not edit generated outputs in `dist/`, `.tmp/`, or `verification/` unless the task explicitly concerns those artifacts.

## Automation test infrastructure

The test suite runs via `scripts/static-test.mjs`: TypeScript is compiled with `tsconfig.test.json` into `.tmp/test-js/`, then each `.test.js` file under `tests/static/` is executed as a standalone Node child process. Tests pass by exiting 0 and fail by exiting non-zero or throwing. There is no test framework (no Vitest, Jest, Mocha). Assertions use `node:assert/strict` via `tests/static/test-utils.ts`, which re-exports `ok`, `equal`, and `deepEqual` only. All 29 test files live in `tests/static/*.test.ts`.

Key test files added by the automation plan:
- `tests/static/fuzz-combat.test.ts` — 50-sequence no-crash fuzz, 40-sequence determinism check, 30-sequence replay JSON validity
- `tests/static/schema-hash-freshness.test.ts` — computes content hash of 6 data modules, compares against `combatSchemaHash`
- `tests/static/config-validate.test.ts` — 27 action frame data validation, 14 status type completeness, tuning baseline consistency, cross-file action reference

## Tool call mistakes to avoid

These mistakes were made during the automation plan implementation and wasted significant time. Do not repeat them.

### TaskList takes no parameters
`TaskList` accepts zero arguments. Calling `TaskList(content="{}")` or `TaskList(content="")` triggers `InputValidationError`. Just call `TaskList()` with no parameters.

### Edit uses snake_case parameter names
The Edit tool uses `file_path`, `old_string`, `new_string`, `replace_all` — NOT camelCase (`filePath`, `newString`, `oldString`, `replaceAll`). Using camelCase causes `InputValidationError`.

### test-utils.ts only exports ok / equal / deepEqual
`tests/static/test-utils.ts` re-exports from `node:assert/strict` and only provides `ok`, `equal`, `deepEqual`. There is no `assert.fail()`. Use `throw new Error("message")` instead, or `assert.ok(false, "message")`.

### TypeScript double-cast needed for FrameDataAction
The `FrameDataAction` type lacks an index signature, so `action as Record<string, unknown>` fails type checking. Use `action as unknown as Record<string, unknown>` (double-cast through `unknown`).

### Node.js built-in modules not available in test tsconfig
`node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:crypto`, `node:url` are not available in test files because `tsconfig.json` does not include `"types": ["node"]`. Tests that need file-system access should import data modules directly (e.g., `import { ACTIONS } from "../../src/combat/actions/FrameDataAction.js"`) rather than reading files from disk.

### Do not re-read files that haven't changed
When the system returns "File unchanged since last read — refer to that instead", stop re-reading. Use the content you already have. Repeated re-reads waste conversation turns.

### Negative whiffCancelFrom is intentional
Actions with `totalFrames=1` (like `Idle`) have `whiffCancelFrom = totalFrames - 4 = -3`. Negative values mean "can never whiff cancel" and are valid. Do not assert `whiffCancelFrom >= 0`. Instead check `whiffCancelFrom <= totalFrames`.

### RagingFury has 10 pillars, not 8
The tuning baseline file (`dnf-berserker-baseline.ts`) documents 8 pillars, but the actual `FrameDataAction.ts` code has 10 (`[15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33]`). The baseline is stale — trust the code.
